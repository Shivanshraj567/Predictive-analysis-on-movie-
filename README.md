# Predictive Analysis on Movie Budget Dataset

This project aims to perform predictive analysis on movie budget data collected from [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/). The dataset includes various features such as movie genre, production budget, domestic and international box office revenues, release date, and more.

## Tools Used
- Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization to gain insights from the dataset.
- Scikit-learn: Utilized for building predictive models and evaluating their performance.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `visualizations/`: Visualizations generated during data analysis.

## Data Collection
The dataset was collected from The Numbers website using web scraping techniques. It includes information on movies released over a specific period, including their budget, revenue, genre, and release date.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of movie budgets, revenues, and genres
- Correlation analysis between features
- Visualizations to understand relationships and trends

## Modeling
- Feature selection
- Model selection: Regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

## Results
The predictive models were trained and evaluated on the dataset. The performance metrics indicate how well the models can predict movie budgets based on various features.

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning models for better performance
- Incorporating additional features or external datasets for improved predictions
- Deployment of the model for real-time predictions
